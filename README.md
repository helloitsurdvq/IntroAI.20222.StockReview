# Intro to AI (IT3160E) Capstone Project - Group 07

## Corporate Stock Review 

### Overview
In this project, we will implement sentiment analysis techniques to analyze stock reviews to
evaluate how the sentiment impacts stock performance. Positive reviews can drive up the stock
price and attract more investors, while negative reviews can cause a decline in stock price and
investor confidence. The aims of this project is to implement a sentiment classifier to:
- Assign a large set of corporate stock reviews to the several levels of polarity of opinion as
accurately as possible.
- Identify the most commonly mentioned positive and negative aspects of the organization.

Here is the weights file of trained models (phoBERT, DBLSTM, DBGRU, xlm-Roberta): [Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fV3k4jnYKowYhtSTEi60p7Uek5oM_lGk?usp=sharing).

### Data Source
Vietnamese major articles on business and finance (CafeF, VnExpress etc.).

### Setup
*We highly recommend you to use the google colab (pro) version because of its built-in libraries and our models are quite large (~500mb)*
- For evaluation, run each notebook file in `source` folder.
- For testing, to run this project, you first have to download all mentioned weights files of model. Then simply run each notebook of our project in `source/07_demo.ipynb` file or run the web application with `python app/app.py`.
